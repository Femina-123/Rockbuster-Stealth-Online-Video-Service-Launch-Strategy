# Rockbuster-Stealth-Online-Video-Service-Launch-Strategy
This repository contains data analysis for Rockbuster Stealth LLC as it transitions to an online video rental service. Tasks include loading data into an RDBMS, conducting SQL analyses, and providing insights to guide the company's strategy against competitors like Netflix and Amazon Prime.
# Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
As a data analyst in Rockbuster Stealth’s Business Intelligence (BI) department, your role is to assist with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department supports other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.
# Context
To answer these questions, you'll query the data using SQL (structured query language). Throughout this project, you'll learn SQL incrementally and use it to answer increasingly complex business questions. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, requiring data visualization in an easy-to-consume manner. Although this project focuses on the online video streaming industry, the skills you develop will be applicable to any industry, showcasing your problem-solving capabilities for various clients.
